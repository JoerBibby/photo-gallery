  This is an app which allows the user to upload photos, have them stored in a cloud service and then displayed in a kind of online gallery.
  This project was an opportunity for me to familarize myself further with the various services firebase offers, I created custom hooks to interface with the firestore database and the cloud storage. Most of the more complex implementations were to do with design and user experience, for example rendering a progress bar which tracked the upload progress, adding smooth animations for when the user adds a new picture or clicks on a picture opening a modal.
  In the future i would like to add an account and auth system allowing each user access to thier own private gallery.
